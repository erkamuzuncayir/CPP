# Lesson 5

1. **system("pause");**
For the stops the program and alert to "Press any key to continue...".

        #include <iostream>

        using namespace std;

        int main()

        {

            cout << "Hello World!" << endl;

            system("pause");
            
            return 0;
        }

2. VSCode has a feature calling **breakpoint**. This is a red button near the line number and it can stop the program when program reach that line. It's useful for debugging.
